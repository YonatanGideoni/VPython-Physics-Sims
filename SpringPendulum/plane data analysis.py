# This code is to help analyze large amounts of experimental data obtained from testing a spring pendulum system.
# Specifically, during the spring pendulum's motion it changes between several main planes of motion in
# a continuous manner. Here, I analyze whether the angle between consecutive planes and the time it takes for
# the pendulum to change its plane of motion are constant.

# Things that the code needs to do, in order:
# 0. Create x(z) chart, add to results
# 1. Calculate "instability" data, AKA distance from origin for every point.
# 2. Find all local maximum instability points.
# 3. Find local maximums' local maximum points.
# 4. Use these points to identify time-ranges during which the pendulum is swinging in a certain plane.
# 5. Calculate average instability.
# 6. Use average instability to filter out close points (say, all points with under-average stability) as they
#    do not represent well what plane the pendulum is swinging in.
# 7. Get lists of points per plane.
# 8. Use SciPy linear regression to find slope and r^2 of plane.
# 9. Calculate angle of every plane.
# 10. Calculate change of angle between planes.
# 11. Print to results slope, r^2, plane angle, change of angle between planes, and transition time between planes.
# 12. Graph change of angle between planes and transition time, add to results.
# 13. Save excel file and hope that the physics works just as well as the code.
